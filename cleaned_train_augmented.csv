"I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get.",-1
"And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.",-1
I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation.,-1
I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.,0

I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.,1
And people -- not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I've made.,-1

"Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records.",1

"Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia.",1
We need more troops there.,-1
And we have to keep our military strong.,-1
There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.,1

"But the exciting thing is, the fear of nuclear war is down.",-1

"As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.",-1
"Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or lose them.",1
"And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.",1
I would never and have never in all the years I've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court.,1

"But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.",-1
"And I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault.",-1
We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.,1
And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.,-1
Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about.,0

"That's the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's what we're going to do in the next four years.",-1
What Mr. Gore's plan will do causing huge payroll taxes or major benefit reductions.,-1
I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.,-1
But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things.,-1
So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.,-1
I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.,-1

And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.,0
Coming out of World War II it made sense.,-1
"I'd like to answer the question, because I've actually been a governor for 12 years, so I've known a lot of people who have lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas, and I know a lot of people whose plants have been strengthened by increasing exports.",1

"So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line.",-1

And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.,-1
It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.,-1
"But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.",1

And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts.,1
That's why I fight against poverty.,-1
And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this.,-1
That's not the way I would have done it.,-1
No litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution.,-1

You have a raging debate about those plans.,-1
So I stand with them.,-1
I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.,-1

"No, because I'm pledged to that, and yes, some taxes have gone up.",0
And Mr. Ford hasn't done anything about it.,1
"Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler.",-1
"And I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave.",0
"I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.",1
I think the foremost (Applause),-1
It's what the federal government does to you.,-1

"Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job.",-1
And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much.,-1
The President trusts the government.,-1
"We can't get involved in the quagmire, but we must do what we can.",-1
"You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue?",0

These interest rates we have now don't make any sense.,-1
"I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence.",-1
The challenges that we face are unprecedented.,-1
"It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.",1

"Every time there's been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them.",1
"Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn't be spent in any other nation.",1

I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.,-1
"Look, I fully recognize I'm not of Washington.",0
"But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that we'll give them adequate attention, as far as - as strength derived from doing what's right - caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world - in those respects, we're not strong.",-1

Some people say that's a hatchet.,-1
"And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.",-1
And I am not going to lay down my arms in the middle of the campaign for somebody who has got no credibility on the issue.,-1
"Over the last ten years since he's been governor, they're 30% behind, 30% -- they're 30% of the national average.",1
And so does Michael Feinberg.,-1
He's been traveling in some other country.,0
But I've supported Medicare ever since.,1
We're a country of laws.,-1
And so I don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time.,-1
In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.,-1
"And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.",-1
"I mean, this is a little defensive on your part, Susan, to be honest with you.",-1
"I remember going down to Del Rio, Texas.",0

I see what it does.,-1
"I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...",-1
"But it's -- the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good.",-1
First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said.,-1

We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.,1
"I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so.",-1
"One vote doesn't make a difference.""",-1
"There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can't afford them.",-1
"Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.",-1

I've worked on that long and hard.,0
"If you did that you could take away the incumbents' advantage because challengers like me would have a chance to run against incumbents like him for House races and Senate races, and then the voters could make up their own mind without being subject to an unfair fight.",-1

"No, there's no difference on that.",-1
"The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.",-1
"And I would hope that we would give to women in this country the right to make that decision, and to make it in the exercise of their conscience and religious beliefs.",-1
"The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns.",-1
"But to add one other feature, I don't control any of the tapes.",1
"In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.",-1
"And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said ""I'm going to give tax cuts"" -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said ""tax cuts to everybody,"" including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history.",0

"I'm sorry we didn't have a foreign policy question, because just this week Secretary Christopher said, ""Well, we really didn't know much the first couple of years about foreign policy.""",-1
Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.,-1

"In addition to that, we're going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.",1

We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund.,1
We all fight over how much money is there.,-1

"To the extent humanly possible, we get that out.",-1

I will just say my time is running out here.,-1
And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility.,-1
"Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.",-1
I thought that was a mistake.,-1
It is not a good deal for the American people.,-1
But all this by itself is not enough.,-1
"And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.",1

It's one of the major priorities of my administration.,-1

"Look, the problem is that under Governor Bush's plan, $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, under his own budget numbers, he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1% than all the new money he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined.",1
And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.,-1
"And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business.",1
We have -- we have a president talking about someone's plan in a way that's completely foreign to what my real plan is.,-1
We need to reform these programs.,-1
The Reagan-Bush administration was right.,-1
"It's small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.",1

Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?,-1
Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.,1

We paid down the debt for two years.,1
The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans.,1
It is -- it is a huge problem.,-1

Our government is that point now.,-1
... and a great first lady.,-1
I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.,1
So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened.,-1
"We've got a very good record appointing women to high positions and positions of trust, and I'm not defensive at all about it.",1
"When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.",1
"First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated.",1
That's what elections are all about.,-1
All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.,-1
Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country?,-1
"And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt.",1
But that's what the election's about.,-1
"Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.",1
And I know talks have started again today.,0
I think it's the attitude.,-1
And the -- the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved?,-1
But there are many people who I admire in this country today.,-1
"Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment.",-1
"Well, we are the ones who found those.",-1
"For comparable states our size, we're signing them up as fast as any other state.",1
That's how in banking it works.,-1
"I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.",-1
There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process.,1
"That's why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make.",-1
I think it's been a very constructive debate and I hope it's helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan.,-1
"One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.",1
But let me start with what you said.,-1
I know the President's been puffing a lot on that.,-1
I'll look at it at the time.,-1
We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here.,-1
"As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that.",-1
"Look, you have to build a consensus, but in some things -- Ross mentioned Saddam Hussein.",0
"Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.",-1
"And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?",-1
I've been able to set clear goals.,-1
"We ought to pursue strategies with each of them, economic and the rest, that help them pull away from their dependence upon the Soviet Union.",-1
Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America.,1
"And by two to one, Congress is blamed for these deficits.",0
It's time for America to find new leadership.,-1
And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.,1
"We guard those like the secrets of the atomic bomb, literally.",0
...that's a -- I indicated...,-1
We cut the deficit by 60 percent.,1
But I have no loans with Russia.,1
"Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important.",-1
But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration.,0
You don't know who broke in to DNC.,-1
"And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase.",1
"I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.",1
"The constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school, in my view would be a great idea.",-1
"And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce.",-1
"I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense.",-1
And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.,-1
"Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there's going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one.",-1
That is the bottom line.,-1
"Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.",0
I have to pay the administration a compliment.,-1
I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time.,-1
Just want to make sure they're safe.,-1
You were totally in favor of it.,1
I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.,-1
I'm not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we've discussed tonight.,-1
Didn't bring in enough nation.,-1
Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.,1
"And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now.",-1

103,"Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable."

111,And I know that they know that I'll take care of them.
112,And that's going to be my job.
113,I don't think I need any on-the-job training.
114,"Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you."
115,"Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry."
116,"They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry."

121,And so we've got to reverse this.
122,I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
123,And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.
124,"Last point I want to make, though."
125,"Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees."
126,And I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income.
127,Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses.
128,"Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks."
129,"What I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent."
130,"And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now."
131,"Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy."
132,"In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around."
133,Who -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now?
134,"Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around."
135,"Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order..."
136,"I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself."
137,"But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it."
138,"Well, I don't mind paying a little more."
139,Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent.
140,We need to cut the business tax rate in America.
141,"Now, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes."
142,"We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around."
143,"Well, first of all, I think it's important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that's important to understand."
144,But there is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and we're going to have to make some adjustments.
145,So let me get to that.
146,"And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don't work, we should cut."
147,I mentioned health care earlier.
148,"And we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means."
149,"During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation."
150,But -- OK. All right.
151,"Energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy independence."
152,We have to have nuclear power.
153,"OK, what -- what would I cut?"
154,"Government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we're giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China."
155,I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending.
156,Senator Obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects...
157,And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.
158,"When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion."
159,And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.
160,And let me tell you...
161,"He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year."
162,He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed.
163,"So the fact is, let's look at our records, Senator Obama."
164,We need to move in a new direction.
165,"Let me just say, Bob."
166,So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.
167,"So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign."
168,This is a tough campaign.
169,"And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, ""I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,"" you didn't tell the American people the truth because you didn't."
170,And that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part.
171,Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obama's campaign than any time since Watergate.
172,"Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough."
173,"I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine."
174,"And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply."
175,You've got to read what he said...
176,"The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth."
177,We do and I hope...
178,"But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues."
179,"I mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other's campaigns."
180,"Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist."
181,"The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for ""lighting and site selection."""
182,"So all of these things need to be examined, of course."
183,Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.
184,Let me tell you who I associate with.
185,And the facts are facts and records are records.
186,"Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country."
187,"Her husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too."
188,"I agree with that, John."
189,"I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if we're going to get serious in terms of research."
190,I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects.
191,"But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength."
192,He voted against the first Gulf War.
193,"Senator Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe."
194,"Look, we've sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them."
195,"But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem."
196,We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.
197,"But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement."
198,"And when it comes to South Korea, we've got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States."
199,"We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea."
200,We've got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that.
201,"Well, you know, I admire so much Senator Obama's eloquence."
202,"Now, on the subject of free trade agreements."
203,But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes.
204,"So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement."
205,"Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again."
206,"Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line."
207,The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you.
208,We've got to put more money into preventive care.
209,And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things.
210,We need to put health care records online.
211,The rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is.
212,We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools.
213,"Now, Senator Obama, I'd like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don't think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America's economy."
214,So here's what we do.
215,"For the first time in history, you will be taxing people's health care benefits."
216,"By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000."
217,"The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $5,800."
218,"I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability."
219,This will give them availability.
220,This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies.
221,"I want, Joe, you to do the job."
222,I want to leave money in your pocket.
223,That's what I'm all about.
224,And don't take my word for it.
225,"All I want to do, if you've already got health care, is lower your costs."
226,That's not appropriate to do.
227,I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states.
228,"Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated."
229,This is a very important issue we're talking about.
230,Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards.
231,And so that's what I will do.
232,I would consider anyone in their qualifications.
233,"And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president."
234,Now I would not provide a litmus test.
235,I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.
236,We have to change the culture of America.
237,Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that.
238,And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.
239,"Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion."
240,"Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible."
241,"Yes, let me respond to this."
242,We should try to reduce these circumstances.
243,"Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama."
244,"If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system."
245,Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.
246,"Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer."
247,So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.
248,"Look, we must improve education in this country."
249,"As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available."
250,I think it's important to foster competition inside the public schools.
251,And we need to fix a lot of the problems.
252,I think the Head Start program is a great program.
253,We need to have transparency.
254,And we'll care for these young children.
255,I'll just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C.
256,And that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.
257,In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future.
258,And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.
259,But it's not going to be easy.
260,I'm absolutely convinced we can do it.
261,"Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight."
262,Freedom is on the march.
263,We're going to make it affordable and accessible.
264,I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker.
265,"When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times."
266,"I've had shop stewards stand up and say, ""Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?"
267,I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.
268,And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.
269,"I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives."
270,"When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times."
271,He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times.
272,"You know, Bob, I don't know."
273,"But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace."
274,"It's between a woman, God and her doctor."
275,I was an altar boy.
276,Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets.
277,"I've actually passed 56 individual bills that I've personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills."
278,"But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write -- I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s."
279,And I'm very proud of that.
280,But I got a better plan.
281,"If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American."
282,"Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis."
283,Americans ought to have it too.
284,"There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem."
285,The fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history.
286,And that's what we're going to do.
287,We're going to protect Social Security.
288,"And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1.6 million jobs."
289,I have a plan to put America back to work.
290,Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts.
291,But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners.
292,"We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border."
293,"And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs."
294,I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior.
295,"The fact is, we haven't done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will."
296,"Well, I'm glad you raised that question."
297,"One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we're supposed to value so much in America -- I'm tired of politicians who talk about family values and don't value families."
298,What we need to do is raise the minimum wage.
299,We also need to hold on to equal pay.
300,That's not right in America.
301,You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem.
302,Is that a new question or a 30-second question?
303,Five hundred thousand kids lost after-school programs because of your budget.
304,There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security.
305,"But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard."
306,"In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait."
307,"I've been a hunter since I was a kid, 12, 13 years old."
308,Now I'm the senior Democrat on it.
309,"Now, let me just share something."
310,"If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers?"
311,"I agree, we shouldn't have quotas."
312,"Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college?"
313,"I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going."
314,"Well, I respect everything that the president has said and certainly respect his faith."
315,And people all find their ways to express it.
316,"And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet."
317,I love the strong women around me.
318,I can't tell you how much I love my wife and our daughters.
319,"And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight."
320,"I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them."
321,I ask you for your trust.
322,And God bless the United States of America.
323,"It's the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone. """
324,"I love the optimism in that painting, because that's how I feel about America."
325,I want to thank you for listening tonight.
326,I'm asking for your vote.
327,Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part - or alleged part - in what has happened in Cuba.
328,"There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953."
329,There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked.
330,In the first place I've never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present.
331,"But when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev."
332,I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment.
333,"Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools."
334,Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody.
335,We are a goldfish bowl before the world.
336,Let me s- look also at what I did.
337,There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs.
338,Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.
339,"We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed."
340,Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill.
341,I was the floor manager.
342,"Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work."
343,"I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century."
344,"On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon."
345,"Now, many of the programs that I'm talking about - economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources - build the strength of the United States."
346,We're using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today.
347,"But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world."
348,You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate.
349,We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.
350,"I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line."
351,"This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country."
352,I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused.
353,I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.
354,That is the obligation upon our generation.
355,Is the United States standing still?
356,What kind of programs are we for?
357,I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.
358,Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.
359,"Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee."
360,In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.
361,I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.
362,Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.
363,"As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries."
364,Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?
365,My objection here is not the cost in dollars.
366,And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five.
367,Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives.
368,That's why we have to continue to be alert.
369,Now that isn't the test of whether America moves.
370,"Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we've had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period."
371,"I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government."
372,And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress.
373,But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.
374,The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security.
375,The means are at issue.
376,"What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget."
377,Why not leave it with them?
378,"Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself."
379,"When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test."
380,"That is just a downpayment, in my opinion."
381,But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly.
382,"We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from."
383,"And the problem is, with Governments - Federal, State and Local - taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities."
384,"And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income."
385,This is 1980 and not 1966.
386,"Now also, with regard to the figures about California."
387,"Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won't take a position on that."
388,"Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion."
389,"On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago."
390,"With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all."
391,"I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again."
392,"A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November."
393,"Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this -- this debate."
394,"I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated -- this was in Philadelphia -- and she said, ""I've got my degree."
395,We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.
396,I know what it takes to get this economy going.
397,I'm going to change that.
398,"Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright."
399,"And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we've created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone."
400,Well what you're seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job.
401,We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years.
402,Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades.
403,We've also got to look to the future.
404,"We've got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas."
405,So where'd the increase come from?
406,I was in coal country.
407,I'll get America and North America energy independent.
408,We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada.
409,How much did you cut them by?
410,I'm happy to answer the question.
411,Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent.
412,And production on gas --
413,"And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up."
414,I don't think the American people believe that.
415,And we need to win that future.
416,And I intend to win it as President of the United States.
417,Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class?
418,"And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class."
419,"A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration."
420,"Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that's what I've done, by $3,600.00."
421,It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.
422,I think that grows the economy.
423,I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.
424,"The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today."
425,We don't have to live like this.
426,"Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion."
427,"Well, Katherine, that's a great question."
428,"And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids."
429,"I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America."
430,"She said, I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night."
431,Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.
432,"In the -- in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs."
433,"I mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago."
434,An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy.
435,"Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage."
436,And I've got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have.
437,And I appreciate that question.
438,The time -- the time...
439,Let me come back and -- and answer your question.
440,President Bush and I are -- are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.
441,"He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years."
442,I know how to make that happen.
443,"We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started."
444,"Now, we've seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created."
445,We've brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we've won every single one that's been decided.
446,"Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs."
447,But the last point I want to make is this.
448,He said that by now we'd have unemployment at 5.4 percent.
449,The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.
450,"The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans."
451,"Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery."
452,"And that record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need."
453,"Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work."
454,Thank you for your question.
455,"But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants."
456,I want it to be streamlined.
457,I want it to be clearer.
458,We should make sure our legal system works.
459,There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally.
460,So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.
461,I mean we're just a few miles away from Ellis Island.
462,"Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the -- any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years."
463,He was asked this on Univision the other day.
464,"Mr. President, I'm still speaking."
465,"Mr. President, let me finish."
466,I do want to make sure that -- I do want to make sure that we just understand something.
467,And we want to encourage that.
468,"Thank you Kerry for your question, it's an important one."
469,And today there's a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy.
470,"Syria -- Syria's not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic -- strategically significant player for America."
471,"Can you say that a little louder, Candy?"
472,The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how --
473,I'm happy to have a longer conversation --
474,But -- but it'll -- it'll -- it'll be...
475,OK. We need to create jobs here.
476,And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate.
477,"The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports."
478,"And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president."
479,We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level.
480,"We will have to have people play on a fair basis, that's number one."
481,"Thank you, and that's an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it."
482,I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future.
483,I care about our kids.
484,I will get us on track to a balanced budget.
485,I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world's ever known.
486,And I want to fight for them.
487,"Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question."
488,"And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket."
489,The middle-class need a rescue package.
490,"And then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families."
491,"And, Alan (ph), thank you for your question."
492,You go to the heart of America's worries tonight.
493,It's our job to fix the problem.
494,"Now, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence."
495,We have to keep Americans' taxes low.
496,Let's not raise taxes on anybody today.
497,We've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world.
498,And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.
499,"But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual."
500,She knows how to create jobs.
501,Prosperity is not just going to trickle down.
502,"And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet."
503,Senator McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices.
504,"Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill."
505,I think it depends on what we do.
506,Americans' workers are the best in the world.
507,And we've got to give them a chance.
508,They've got -- we've got to give them a chance to do their best again.
509,Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much.
510,"When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion."
511,"And so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history."
512,So here's what I would do.
513,We are mortgaging our children's future.
514,Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue.
515,And we need to reform.
516,I don't expect you to watch every vote.
517,I think it's very important that we reform our entitlement programs.
518,So we've got to deal with that right away.
519,And we can do it.
520,So that would be priority number one.
521,We do need to look at our records.
522,That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.
523,"Well, Fiora (ph), I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate."
524,I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks.
525,"And, by the way, I want to go back a second."
526,"Look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time."
527,"We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together."
528,That wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.
529,We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.
530,"But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings."
531,"Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden."
532,"Well, you know, nailing down Senator Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall."
533,"I've got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad."
534,"So let's be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in."
535,"Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year."
536,"Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street."
537,I want to get to Medicare in a second.
538,Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue.
539,"When he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut."
540,And our best days are ahead of us.
541,"Now, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it?"
542,"Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs."
543,"And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment."
544,"And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times."
545,We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.
546,I'm just trying to keep up with John.
547,I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate.
548,"By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth."
549,"If you've got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years."
550,"Well, thank you for the question."
551,And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient.
552,Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies.
553,"I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit."
554,Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America?
555,But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability.
556,We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.
557,So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference.
558,All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it.
559,"Well, I thank you for that question, because there's no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well."
560,And that is one of the challenges that America faces.
561,"Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand."
562,"We've spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we're on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, it's going to go well over $1 trillion."
563,"Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake."
564,"If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in?"
565,"And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible."
566,Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.
567,And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.
568,"Well, let me just follow up, my friends."
569,"And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again."
570,But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation.
571,And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda.
572,"And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out."
573,And that is to get the support of the people.
574,"And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick."
575,It'd be fine with me.
576,"We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan."
577,And we want a democracy in Afghanistan.
578,And I've had conversations with him.
579,We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure.
580,We have to do a lot of things.
581,We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.
582,"But the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors."
583,And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken.
584,But we can't just provide moral support.
585,"The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners."
586,And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe.
587,"Well, thank you, Terry (ph)."
588,And thank you for your service to the country.
589,And I think we can do that.
590,"But, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what it's like to serve, and you know what it's like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place."
591,It would be a game-changer in the region.
592,And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.
593,"Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000."
594,But here's what I do know.
595,And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation?
596,That's what's at stake in this election.
597,"There are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different -- we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans."
598,I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our country's business.
599,I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times.
600,I thought that was a good model.
601,I don't think we agree on that.
602,And I think that's a private matter.
603,"And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999."
604,I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance.
605,We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people.
606,And Texas is number one in industrial pollution.
607,"That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations - recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard - recommendations with regard to - again - slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if - in effect, to the Communists."
608,"And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies."
609,"And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line."
610,I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955.
611,In 1957 I was in Havana.
612,And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world.
613,There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine.
614,But are we doing enough in these areas?
615,Are we doing enough in that area?
616,I think we are today.
617,"Now, what can we do?"
618,"He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains."
619,So that is my answer to this question.
620,"Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public."
621,"What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world."
622,"I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again."
623,This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level.
624,"I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points."
625,We can make it move.
626,"If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign."
627,Let's talk about civil rights.
628,Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling in America.
629,"It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world."
630,And this means more than what we've been doing.
631,The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island.
632,The treaty does not include these two islands.
633,"Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris."
634,There have been many wars in the history of mankind.
635,"Now, we may not succeed."
636,What do we do then?
637,But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.
638,"I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island."
639,"I don't suggest that, I don't support it."
640,"On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce."
641,"Uh - Also, so that we can get the uh - opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate."
642,The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited.
643,"My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson's program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history."
644,"I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate."
645,"We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America."
646,We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas.
647,And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.
648,I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less.
649,I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead.
650,Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us.
651,I thought you'd forgotten I was here.
652,So I have to stand up for myself.
653,I don't think we're a declining nation.
654,"Then the question is, can we govern?"
655,"In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War."
656,"In addition, we've brought down inflation."
657,"And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal - and I quote them, I think - was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation."
658,We've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office.
659,It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford.
660,It is now running at 12.7%.
661,Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation.
662,We don't have inflation because the people are living too well.
663,I'll have to get this out very fast.
664,He more than doubled state spending while he was Governor - 122% increase - and had between a 20% and 30% increase in the number of employees
665,"I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded."
666,"That's been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out."
667,"I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind."
668,"Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest I have."
669,Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons.
670,"To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan."
671,We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third.
672,I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can.
673,Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights.
674,I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on.
675,I've been President now for almost four years.
676,"I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way."
677,I consider myself in the mainstream of my party.
678,"And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world."
679,Next Tuesday is Election Day.
680,I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today.
681,We cut the cost - the increased cost of government - in half over the eight years.
682,And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war.
683,"You know, the American people are fair."
684,They want to judge it on the record itself.
685,"And I don't want to do that, and I won't do that."
686,And it's going to take discipline of the executive branch; it's going to take discipline of the congressional branch.
687,The American people are pretty smart: they know who writes out the checks.
688,And they know who appropriates the money.
689,"And those pessimists who say it can't be done, I'm sorry, I just have a fundamental disagreement with them"
690,"He says he wants to give the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break, and we're going to pay for it."
691,will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States.
692,"We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation."
693,The Governor has to balance the budget in his state he is required to by law.
694,I'm not going to do that; I won't do that.
695,"As a matter of fact, I'm the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system, and I'm very proud of that."
696,"I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way."
697,So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November.
698,"So that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it."
699,"And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people."
700,"But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people."
701,"I think it's whether you share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have confidence in the people's ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do, to Washington, D.C. You see, I think it's a question of values, not likability or loveability, it's a question in foreign affairs in experience, knowing world leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control, because you'd know exactly how to begin."
702,You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace.
703,"It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country."
704,It's our vision of America.
705,"I think this is a great country, because we've always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better."
706,That's the kind of leadership I want to provide.
707,"But I don't think these labels mean a thing and I would hope that tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign, we can have good solid disagreements on issues."
708,"They continue to modernize and we can't simply we've got enough nuclear weapons, let's freeze."
709,"Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions, but it's going to be the President who's going to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the Congress what weapons systems are going to go and what are going to stay."
710,Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make.
711,"Yes, we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent."
712,So military security and economic security go hand in hand.
713,And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.
714,Can we start the clock over?
715,Some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me.
716,We were proud of them.
717,"But more than that, they are role models."
718,These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month.
719,"And there's nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace."
720,I had something very nice to say in there.
721,And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect.
722,I salute those who participate in the political process.
723,We may have different approaches.
724,the tone we've just heard might just be the tone we have for the rest of the campaign.
725,"But that's the way I, George Bush, feel about it."
726,It's not going to happen overnight; it certainly will have to happen on a step-by-step basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms control and arms reduction.
727,"The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedy's time, for example moved tremendously."
728,"See, I don't believe any other country can pick up the mantel."
729,I served at the UN.
730,I don't think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else.
731,We don't give away our hand before we sit down at the head table.
732,The Congress is doing a better job of it.
733,But they don't work if you go raise taxes and then the Congress spends it continues to spend that.
734,And there are several there's a good political reason because it's just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security.
735,I learned that the hard way and the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one year.
736,He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that.
737,We do not have to do it.
738,I won't support judges like that.
739,But I will go out there and find men and women to interpret.
740,"And I don't have a list, but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding, outstanding appointments."
741,"Now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income."
742,"But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children."
743,We're going to tell you how to do it all.
744,You ought to go out and see around this country what's happening in the volunteer section: Americans helping America.
745,I just have to correct the record.
746,"But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just don't believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who can't make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country."
747,It's a contract between generations.
748,"We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products."
749,"So I'll just keep saying, I am one."
750,I'm not going to do that.
751,That boo was excessively loud.
752,I believe in our parks.
753,I will not agree to another debate.
754,"In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it."
755,But I'll try harder to keep it on a high plane.
756,But it's not getting out because there are too few debates.
757,"(Laughter, applause) Isn't that the point?"
758,Most Americans believe in basic values.
759,We have differences about how to achieve them.
760,"But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success."
761,But we also need well-equipped and well-trained and well-supported conventional forces.
762,"Let's get him working on Syria, their client state, and see if we can't get them to join Israel and other Arab nations, if at all possible, and Arab leaders, in finally bringing peace to that troubled region."
763,And I think that's one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East.
764,"Let's go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence."
765,"And we've got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries."
766,Maybe the Vice President has an answer.
767,But I'm somebody who believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first before you start new stuff.
768,"Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the requirements, nuclear material requirements, for our Defense Department?"
769,"This sounds like real progress here, because we've had a big difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base."
770,"I believe that we must use clean, safe nuclear power."
771,So I am one who believes that we can
772,I believe that public service is honorable.
773,I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress.
774,Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat than light.
775,I want to invest in our children.
776,"America stands tall again, and as a result, we are credible."
777,And I ask for your support on November 8th.
778,"Working together, we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World."
779,"Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I'll talk about on my time."
780,"When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s."
781,And this is why a tax reform is so important.
782,"I believe that it's accurate to say that - that the - that the committees to whom you refer with the - the employment that you uh - state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh - projections would be a uh - a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we'd have to spend in l981 compared to now."
783,"But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the - uh pardon or the amnesty of uh - those who evaded the draft, but - but whether or not our crime system is - is fair."
784,We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members.
785,"The last year I was in office uh - our budget was - was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement."
786,We uh - have got to do that at the federal government level.
787,In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment.
788,We'll keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary.
789,The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 - measured in real dollars.
790,"Well among my other experiences in the past, I've - I've been a nuclear engineer, and did graduate work in this field."
791,Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes.
792,"Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports."
793,"So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief - would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?"
794,"I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income."
795,And this is uh - the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich.
796,Governor Carter's answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago.
797,But I think the feeling is misplaced.
798,That's where the problem is and I hope there'll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States.
799,"If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation."
800,I might go back to one other thing.
801,But I think it's time to talk about the future.
802,"It's a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government."
803,I believe in our country.
804,"In addition to that, we've suffered because we haven't had leadership in this administration."
805,"I owe everything to you, the people of this country."
806,We must make this next century the century of the individual.
807,"At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean -- without an increase in tax rates -- that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues."
808,"And so, I think that the lines can meet."
809,"As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they've missed the mark by nearly $600 billion."
810,"I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference."
811,"Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things -- [applause] -- that people need."
812,Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.
813,"We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line."
814,We all know the possibility of terrorism.
815,I am a son of a Methodist minister.
816,"I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead."
817,"When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country."
818,"It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it."
819,The American people want to keep opening doors.
820,"I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months."
821,"All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done."
822,It's now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy.
823,"As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have."
824,This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.
825,But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.
826,You've got another life involved.
827,Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?
828,"But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?"
829,"In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around."
830,I'm not going to increase taxes.
831,You remember the last time you said that?
832,You can't wish it away.
833,"On the other hand, women heads of household -- single women heads of household have -- for the first time there's been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them."
834,We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.
835,Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid.
836,That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything.
837,Certainly education and training is crucial.
838,I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.
839,"We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year."
840,I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent.
841,There's no way of glossing around that.
842,But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.
843,Will you finally touch that defense budget?
844,"I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82."
845,"I did support the '76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation."
846,Is America better off than it was 4 years ago?
847,"But we now have an economy that, for the first time -- well, let's put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent."
848,Today it is up a plus 4 percent.
849,I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate.
850,Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt?
851,"This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and we're now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs."
852,People out there listening know what I believe.
853,It's the hardest decision a president makes.
854,He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.
855,They just need the help to be trained.
856,This president just -- I don't know if he sees what's really happened over there.
857,"But, again, I want to tell the American people, we're doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again."
858,I understand how hard it is.
859,I get the casualty reports every day.
860,It's what leadership is based on.
861,"I have nothing but respect for the British, Tony Blair, and for what they've been willing to do."
862,"So you say, ""Was it worth it?"""
863,"He's a brave, brave man."
864,But a president must always be willing to use troops.
865,"The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind."
866,And I have great respect and admiration for his wife.
867,I think she's a terrific person...
868,"Actually, we've increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I've been the president."
869,My opponent opposed the missile defenses.
870,The issue is what you do about it.
871,I appreciate your listening tonight.
872,And may God continue to bless our great land.
873,But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.
874,And I hope we can do better.
875,"And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history."
876,"Here's the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too."
877,"Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs."
878,I was in coal country in West Virginia yesterday.
879,"When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father."
880,Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant.
881,I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace.
882,They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail.
883,Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime; today there are three crimes for every police officer.
884,I was in the Lomax AME Church.
885,"Therefore, you don't know what's it like."
886,I'd go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one.
887,"And we paid down the debt of our nation for two years in a row, and we created 23 million new jobs at the same time."
888,China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are.
889,"Plus, I want them all voting for me."
890,I was an altar boy.
891,"Thanks for your questions tonight, very, very much."
892,I believe America's best days are ahead of us.

904,We've got to have no more trickle down.
905,"Governor Clinton says $200,000 but he also says he wants to raise $150 billion."

909,We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed.
910,"I've seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I don't want to see us make reckless cuts."
911,"So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base."
912,I agree with the general statement Mr. Bush made.
913,Why do we have to do it?
914,"(Laughter and applause) But--but--see, let me make it very clear."
915,"If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do."

930,"If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China."
931,"I am not going to commit US forces until I know what the mission is, till the military tell me that it can be completed, and till I know how they can come out."
932,"But I must stop short of using American force until I know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in, know what the mission is, and define it."
933,We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up.
934,"But it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people--and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; it's the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions."
935,It's a different world now.
936,"I was born to a widowed mother who gave me family values, and grandparents."

948,We ought to love one another because united teams win and divided teams lose.
949,Our diversity is a strength.
950,"I think whoever is in the White House should just make it absolutely unconscionable and inexcusable, and if anybody's in the middle of a speech at, you know, one of these conventions, I would expect the candidate to go out and lift him off the stage if he starts preaching hate -- because we don't have time for it."
951,We have got to pull together.

962,"We can do better, and we must."
963,"We got the most expensive health care system in the world; it ranks behind 15 other nations when we come to life expectancy, and 22 other nations when we come to infant mortality."
964,I don't like to see the people in a deteriorating economy in a deteriorating country because our government has lost touch with the people.
965,It's time to do it because we have run up so much debt that time is no longer our friend.
966,"Think of your dreams as a child and ask yourself, isn't it time to stop talking about it?"
967,And I'd like to thank those of you who are watching.
968,"I'd like to thank the computer executives and the electronics executives in Silicon Valley, two-thirds of whom are Republicans who said they wanted to sign on to a change in America."
969,"He was president for 3 years before he proposed a health care plan that still hasn't been sent to Congress in total; three years before an economic plan, and he still didn't say tonight that that tax bill he vetoed raised taxes only on the rich and gave the rest of you a break -- but he vetoed it anyway."
970,"On the domestic side, what we must do is have change that empowers people -- not change for the sake of change, tax and spend."

980,"We've opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I've been president."
981,"Well, 88 percent of the people -- the President claims 11 million are already covered and only 5 percent -- keep in mind only 5 percent of the employers are affected by the Family Leave Act."
982,Those are my best ideas about it.
983,All the people who may still be watching or viewing.
984,We're going to have a good economic package.
985,But I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned.
986,"We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military."
987,And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term.
988,Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.

1005,"And we've been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices."

1014,This is a fair plan.
1015,I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow.
